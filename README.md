# Intro to React

Intro to React tutorial with my solutions to the following improvements:  
- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. 
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

Solution can be found in `intro/src/index.js`
